    * web/tests: directory added to contain unit test scripts for use with
      PHPUnit testing framework 
    

2011.10.03  David Z. Chen  <david.chen@yale.edu>

    * web/lib/s3.php: added and begun work on S3Adaptor class to abstract S3
      calls
    * web/lib/config.php: added configuration parser and bootstrapper. 
      config.php must be included at the top of every VAT web script 
    

2011-10-02  David Z. Chen  <david.chen@yale.edu>

    * Makefile.am: Added install hook to Makefile.am to install web components.
    * scripts/*: Created scripts to install
    * default.vatrc: Created as a copy of vatConfiguration.txt and read by
      install scripts during install. Moved to home directory as .vatrc during
      install. Added WEB_DIR_CGI configuration directive to point to directory
      where web components reside. Added VAT_EXEC_DIR directive to point to
      where VAT executables are installed to. WEB_DATA_DIR is now used 
      exclusively for the data directory where the data files reside, which is
      now the data subdirectory in WEB_DIR_CGI.
    * web/vat_upload.php: Changed path for calling VAT executables to the
      VAT_EXEC_DIR setting instead of WEB_DATA_DIR. Changed path config for
      calling tabix and bgzip from WEB_DATA_DIR (incorrect!) to TABIX_DIR.
